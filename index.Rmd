This document details the conversion from the Triad Model's highway network, TAZ structure, and socioeconomic data into the TRMG2 Model. Expansion into Alamance County is a novel component of the TRMG2. The new coverage area, including Mebane and surrounding areas, is included in the Triad Model, so the existing network and demographic data was utilized to eliminate duplicative data collection processes.
